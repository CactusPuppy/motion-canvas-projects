# CactusPuppy's Motion Canvas projects repository
This repository contains (some of) the [Motion Canvas](https://github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas) code used to generate motion graphics for the [CactusPuppy YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@CactusPuppy).

**NOTE**: Some files are omitted either due to copyright or file size. This means that the project will not successfully open in Motion Canvas without modification/substituting replacement files.
